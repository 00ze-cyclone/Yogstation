changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds K-41s DMR to nukie uplink for 12 TC. It's an 11-round rifle that fires 7.62 and possesses a short-range scope. Additional magazine costs 3 TC"
  - rscadd: "Adds 7.62 Raze, a weaker 7.62 round that deals moderate irradiation and clone damage. 4 TC"
  - rscadd: "Adds 7.62 anti-material, an AP round that can pass through two objects/structures before hitting another object, mob, or reaching the end of its reach. 5 TC"
  - rscadd: "Adds 7.62 Vulcan, a weaker round that creates an explosion of exclusively fire upon impact, with no throwing of objects or actual explosion damage. 4 TC"
  - tweak: "Overhauls and standardizes projectile penetration code to be more integrated into the base on_hit checks as well as making it far easier to create or adjust penetrating projectile types. As a consequence, .50 Penetrator now damages EVERYTHING it passes through. X-ray projectiles remain unaffected"
  - tweak: "You now don't need both hands to fire the LWT-650 DMR"
  - imageadd: "Adds new sprites for the K-41s, its magazines, and the new bullets"
